<h3>Or working on remote servers</h3>            <h4>Published on May 10th, 2019</h4>

            </header>
                This is a short blog on using lsycnd, a tool to sync between you and a remote host. Working on a Remote Host In many instances, I find it necessary to work on a remote host. The reasons are numerous, but commonly come down to hardware - I need a GPU … (<a class = "red" href="blog/lsyncd">Continue Reading</a>)

<h3>Histograms, binwidth and the importance of communication</h3>            <h4>Published on January 31st, 2019</h4>

            </header>
                Back in 2015, I was doing a lot of histogram plotting (as a result of MCMC) and was annoyed that I had to keep manually specifying the number of bins. At this stage I was somewhat versed with git (the 3 commands I needed, else delete and do a... (<a class = "red" href="blog/my-contribution-to-numpy">Continue Reading</a>)

            </header>
                My first neural net was actually coded up in 2009. I had decided to go to med school and while hating the degree program, I got a chance to do an elective called "Science in Medicine". I didn't really know how to program at this point, so it was done … (<a class = "red" href="blog/a-bayesians-view-on-neural-nets">Continue Reading</a>)

                This is a short article, primarily full of resources. I assume some basic knowledge of A/B testing A/B testing I must start posting Evan Miller's articles on the subject which I consider a fantastic resource in this area. How not to run an A/B...

            </header>
                I've been learning about reinforcement learning and wonder how it can be applied in my work. A common paradigm of machine learning/data science is to develop a model that can predict and feed those predictions into relatively simple code (or into...
