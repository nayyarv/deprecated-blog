I had decided to go to med school and while hating the degree program, I got a chance to do an elective called "Science in Medicine". I didn't really know how to program at this point, so it was done in excel and I trained a neural net (really a perceptron with 2 input units and a sigmoid activation) to mimc and NAND gate. It is a little known fact that backprop is simple enough to implement in excel. Everyone was suitably impressed (if unsure of what they were seeing), and when I quit to take up a mathematics/engineering degree 6 months later, the signs were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally stopped dabbling in ML and started taking a more formal approach at the start of 2014, I did it primarily out of "Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedmann. In the very first section on neural nets, this was the description they had given&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a great deal of hype surrounding neural networks, making them seem magical and mysterious. As we make clear in this section, they are just non-linear statistical models, much like the projection pursuit regression model discussed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had been published in 2009, a few years before &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet"&gt;Alexnet&lt;/a&gt; and GPU's burst on scene in 2012. As such, the neural nets in the textbook were small, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)"&gt;relu&lt;/a&gt; hadn't even made the cut in activation functions described, and convolutional neural nets were described in some detail, but without the word convolution (called constrained nets). My lecturer had inherited the bias, and through him, I too considered that neural nets were nothing special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my friends from the comp sci department were obsessed with neural nets and anything that could use a neural net, and I think deep learning was slowly coming into use (and I applaud the nomenclature). At the time, I preferred bagging (primarily due to my fondness of non-parametric methods) which live on as random forests and even back then was a hipster in the machine learning space as boosting was the premier ensemble method. I chose to do Bayesian Stats and then mucked around a few different areas (GMMs, Symbolic Data, Approximate Bayesian Computations), all of which have had no bearing on my work since, but I am at least secure in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician%27s_Apology"&gt;my mathematician's apology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently visited a NVIDIA conference, and despite the fact it was actually a sales pitch to managers and C level exec's masquerading as a machine learning conference, it did remove the last objections I had to neural nets (meeting the other conned ML guys was probably more helpful). The basic of the arguments was that the world is inherently non-linear and neural nets are the best way to capture that non-linearity. It wasn't perfect (and after all which model is), it might be discarded quite easily, but we're still doing linear regressions and they're still useful, and in all likelihood, neural nets aren't going anywhere in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hidden Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to use the architecture &lt;a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-2d-cnn-for-mnist-digit-recognition-a998dbc1e79a"&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; to show what I mean (first result for "convolution mnist"). This is an example of a convolutional neural net for the MNIST data. We have (28, 28) grayscale image input and 60000 images. Num categories is 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the keras code he included. I've replaced comments with layer information, and dropped layers that have no effect on input/output/no parameters. Convolutions are deceptively simple, in that a convolution layer has only the number of parameters as the kernel size (plus a bias). Since this uses &lt;code&gt;padding='valid'&lt;/code&gt;, this means for the given (3,3) kernel, the output is (x-2,y-2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;keras&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequential&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;keras.layers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Conv2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MaxPooling2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dropout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flatten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dense&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Sequential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# input = (28, 28, 1)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Conv2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kernel_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;relu&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                 &lt;span class="n"&gt;input_shape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;28&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# output = (26, 26, 32)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 32 conv layers * (9 kernel params + 1 bias param) = 320&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Conv2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;relu&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 32 channels&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# output = (24, 24, 64)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 64 conv * [(32 in channels * 9 kernel params) +  1 bias)] = 18496&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MaxPooling2D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pool_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 0 param&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# output = (12, 12, 64 )&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Flatten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 0 param&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# output = 9216&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Dense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;relu&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# params = (9216 + 1 bias)  * 128 = 1179776&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# output = 128&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Dense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;activation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;softmax&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# params = (128 +1) * 10 = 1290&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# output = 10&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# also!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;param_num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count_params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;layers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now total parameters = 1,199,882. Yep, this simple-seeming model with 4 layers woth parameters has 1.2 million parameters. For a dataset that has 60,000 images, or 47 million pixels. It has a 99% classification accuracy. However, adding a 3rd convolution layer after the pooling step with 32 filters (&lt;code&gt;model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'))&lt;/code&gt;) would actually reduce the number of parameters to 448298. This is a bit counter-intuitive and is representative of how neural net structure needs to be looked at in more care than it's layer size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what other way could we develop a model with 1.2 million parameters (or even 450k). Any regression would have at most 28 x 28 = 784 inputs, any tree would be have parameters as number of leaves and boosting bagging would have ensemble size * average number of leaves. Taking mixture models, say K Gaussian mixtures would have 6K-1 parameters for a 2d space. Other than a neural net, I can't even think of another model that could use as many parameters (maybe SVMs, must investigate)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons neural nets are so powerful is the sheer number of parameters we have it take, allowing for any kind of complexity to be modelled. The parametric forms of most stats try and keep this small to make it easier to calculate, but the nature of the structure means we have a much more complex structure than would otherwise be possible. And this is possible/feasible, primarily due to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The GPU&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's well known that training neural nets is embarrassingly parallel, and that GPUs are very good at parallel tasks. The result was obvious, but I don't think many people realise just how critical GPUs have been to the development of neural nets. At around 2012, clock cycles stopped improving like they were in the years before, Moore's law looked in danger of becoming the number of processors per chip and scientific programming community had been taking advantage of GPU and CUDA code to do various things to tap into more FLOPs than standard compute cores could provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a GPU is a bunch of streaming multiprocessors (&lt;a href="https://github.com/nayyarv/PyCudaIntro"&gt;See my talk on PyCUDA&lt;/a&gt; for more details), it's effectively a multicore cpu where number of cores are optimised over clock speed. Anything that could take advantage of many cores would gain huge benefits. And unlike CPU makers, GPU makers still had a lot of low hanging fruit left to grab, not to mention sticking additional cores wasn't a copout. While they would improve their micro-architecture every so often, the clock rates of each streaming processor hasn't improved greatly, but the number of them increases significantly. In fact, Intel sells versions of GPUs that are packed with CPU cores instead of GPU cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the aforementioned AlexNet leading the way, it'd be near impossible to conceive of the neural nets having the ubiquity they do. If you were limited to CPU only, I'd be very skeptical of seeing the benefits of neural nets we see today. Neural Nets aren't necessarily better on completely even playing field, but when is the field even? Comparing a neural net running on a GPU vs a neural net on a CPU is a pointless exercise in today's data science world. Given the sheer amount of computing power a neural net can harness in a way few other algorithms can, neural nets tend to be a magnitude more complex and correspondingly, a magnitude better. In today's world of large datasets, they're making use of it the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The datasets in modern data science have shifted, and this is particularly evident in image data we have. Traditional stats would have a few thousand rows and tens to hundreds of predictors. Feature selection would happen a few ways (ridge, lasso, random forests) or maybe even dimensionality reduction (PCA, autoencoders), commonly augmented with some additional domain knowledge to help direct model building. And by and large, this is still the common paradigm for many data science tasks - select useful features and start building models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this job of feature selection fails in data that doesn't have such obvious structure. Images, text, video are examples of data that doesn't have a clear structure and despite the best efforts on NLP researchers, the success has been limited. And this is one of the areas deep learning really shines, it picks up it's own features quite well. If you're not sure about how to approach a problem, some deep learning can do most of it for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the biggest drawback is the amount of data you need to train a neural net and this is why the feature select -&amp;gt; model process is still such a dominant paradigm, most datasets don't have the sheer amount of data necessary to throw deep learning at the problem. However, this is changing in the internet era, cursor tracking, image and video, blog posts, reviews etc. all number in the millions, and all have limited structure. There is also reinforcement learning using neural nets to be function approximator for problems that don't have clear solutions (&lt;a href="https://blog.openai.com/openai-five/"&gt;See OpenAi playing videogames&lt;/a&gt;). Problems like these, that have been mostly untouched or have had mostly underwhelming results have really benefitted from this approach, and the growth of packages like keras, tensorflow, pytorch etc, have really allowed people to build neural nets of far greater complexity than previously doable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We can be Data Scientists too!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this has led to Data Scientists of all kinds, from the bootcamps to the hardened mathematicians throwing neural nets at every problem that dares to rear it's head. We see CNNs and RNNs taking over the space (though apparently RNNs are falling out of fashion). The packages make it easy, the open data initiatives help a lot too, and the ease at which one can build a neural net has led to every interview candidated wax lyrical about them and how they solved a problem with them. You can actually use neural net infrastructure to build logistic regressions, or even linear regressions should you choose to do so (though you don't get all the nice statistics on parameter usefulness and statistics on goodness of fit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean you don't need Data Scientists? No, even just to build a neural net architecture you need a good understanding of parameter vs data space, you need to know how complex is the problem and thus how complex your architecture needs to be and you need to try a few different architectures. And to solve a problem, using a neural net is only 1 tool of many, it may not even be the appropriate tool for the problem. If you've got 100 predictors, 1000 observations, 10 outcoms, it's probably not be the right approach. Or if it needs to be delivered by a team that doesn't have a strong technical stack or if the neural net approach is only midly better, there are a lot of considerations that go into building data science solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without Yann LeCunn's famous (but ultimately confusing with context) "Deep Learning is Dead", even Andrew Ng, deep learning's most famous champion, has stopped posting about it on twitter with such regularity. There's definitely a feeling that deep learning isn't giving us greater results as we throw new network architectures and computing power at the problem. It's growth is from it's application to various problems (from TB screening to automatically searching images). The more pessimistic are &lt;a href="https://blog.piekniewski.info/2018/05/28/ai-winter-is-well-on-its-way/"&gt;saying we're in an AI winter&lt;/a&gt; (results have dried up and so too will funding), but what we're seeing is not the end of Deep Learning, rather the end of Deep Learning hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems with Deep Learning have become apparent, and primarily as people have become more well versed in it, they've also become more well-versed with it's limitations. The standard scientific approach of making big claims that get disproved in subsequent publications still holds even in Deep Learning and the twitter verse. The very hype driven nature of this field means that successes are shouted from all over while the embarrassing failures are hidden away (self driving car crashes aside). The fact that most of the research is being driven by large corporations (Baidu, Facebook etc) also represents a change in how machine learning has been advanced, and only exacerbated the hype machine without the pessimissim that academics level at anything daring to call itself 'new'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has definitely been revolutionary in the image/video space and will definitely stick around for a long time there (and likely other fields like language processing), until something new and well named comes along and displaces it. Nothing ever lives up to it's own hype after all, and frankly speaking, Deep Learning and Neural Nets haven't done too bad. For people in the field, neural nets are something we should know, but not to the exclusion of everything else, and it shouldn't be the only hammer in our toolkit (lest everything starts to look like a nail). As hype machines find new areas (I bet reinforcement learning is gonna up it's hype game), we need to constantly throw away most of what we know and start again, likely multiple times for each hype machine, and it's our foundations that allow us to approach new topics, pick up new things and work out how to apply new approaches to new problems, lest be become one trick pony.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="skeptical"></category><category term="ds"></category><category term="advice"></category><category term="neuralnets"></category><category term="neural"></category><category term="deeeplearning"></category><category term="hype"></category></entry><entry><title>A/B testing / Bandit Methods</title><link href="/blog/ab-testing-bandit-methods" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-22T10:20:00+11:00</published><updated>2018-10-22T10:20:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Varun Nayyar</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-10-22:/blog/ab-testing-bandit-methods</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a short article, primarily full of resources.

I assume some basic knowledge of A/B testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A/B testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must start posting Evan Miller's articles on the subject which I consider a fantastic resource in this area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html"&gt;How not to run an A/B test&lt;/a&gt; - never end an A/B test before it's allocated run time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/sequential-ab-testing.html"&gt;Sequential A/B testing&lt;/a&gt; - How to run an A/B test that allows for stopping early without ruining results. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html"&gt;Bayesian A/B testing&lt;/a&gt; - a Bayesian approach that allows one to 'peek' whenever necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this article on &lt;a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/the-low-base-rate-problem.html"&gt;statstical power&lt;/a&gt; is also something worth reading as it touches on assessing significance as your click and lift is low - basically the lower the success rate is, the more samples you need to ensure that you've reached significance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A/B Testing Summary + Skepticism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the approaches of A/B testing use the same tech backend. The Sequential and Bayesian approaches allow for checking the results partway through, so there is an expectation that you can check on your results every so often, and maybe even automate this part&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional A/B testing is the most robust approach - if you use an early stop version, you run the risk of catching significance on a certain day. For example, testing a greeting that uses "Monday" performs better on monday and might show significance that wouldn't be ther when run over a period of a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, the bayesian approach is preferred over sequential testing. Or at least has found more wide adoption. This is primarily because you still need to choose a sample size at the beginning, a restriction not present in the bayesian approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of debate over traditional a/b testing vs bayesian methodology, and the basic answer is that it's not that important. If you want robustness, go traditional, if you expect a big lift, go bayesian so you can stop the experiment as soon as you're confident in the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The traditional A/B testing is much better known, is easier to implement and is less likely to confuse someone than a bayesian approach. Frequentist results are easier to misinterpret than Bayesian results, but bayesian results are harder to arrive at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bayesian methods are more computationally intensive than the equivalent frequentist statistics and has fewer well known implementations. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/bayesian-frequentist-ab-testing/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; runs through the various differences in much greater detail.
&lt;a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/12-ab-split-testing-mistakes-i-see-businesses-make-all-the-time/"&gt;And this article&lt;/a&gt; lists a few other common errors common in A/B testing in real life, with a very heavy web bias. 
A/B testing does exist in other scenarios (traditionally in use of new medical treatments), but the Web has been a much more fertile ground for turning this up to 11. The original ethical concerns of stopping an effective medical trial early have only been approached in the internet age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bandit Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/01/23/the-multi-armed-bandit-problem-and-its-solutions.html"&gt;Bandit methods&lt;/a&gt; are the other side of the coin which basically approach the problem of trying a few different methods, seeing the success of one over the other and presenting the more successful one more often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More precisely, we set a parameter epsilon which is an indication of our exploration rate that we reduce over the period of our testing (a week for example). We then choose a random page if epsilon &amp;gt; random() otherwise, we serve our best page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bandit methods are a similar response to traditional A/B testing, the question of regret. When you have a better method (say a donation webpage) that's outperforming your old one, you lose a lot of money for each day you run the A/B test. Also, if you run a lot of A/B tests, setting up and analysing at the end is always a pain, can you set you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bandt Summary + Skepticism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A more involved tech stack. While A/B testing simply records result of web A/B interaction, bandit methods need to store result of the interaction and then work out which webpage to show based on past results. Unlike a simple random call to determine which page to show, the code at the delivery layer is a bit more involved. This is likely the big issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandit methods are quite fragile - they rely on instant feedback to adjust the probability of returning the best value. Email campaigns or conversions that are non-instant break the fundamental assumptions of bandit methods and can lead to it acting quite erratic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly to above, a certain day of the week can push a bandit method into prime position that stays at the top for a while. Contrastingly, a bandit method won't realise that a certain page is more effective on certain days. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandit methods need careful consideration of setup and exploration. Since the exploitation tends to favour one over the other, using it tends to result in a massive imbalance, and you can converge to non-ideal answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of the distributions involved allows you to put a bayesian spin on the answer. In particular tracking the upper confidence bound is generally a better idea since you get more certainty the more you exploit and you include potential value in your equations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandit methods don't give you inference - the imbalance means you don't ever have a sample size that's big enough in both categories to give you the inference you're after. At the end of a bandit run, you're unlikely to be completely sure you've found the best answer, though you can try various strategies to ensure the certainty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bandit vs A/B&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://conversionxl.com/blog/bandit-tests/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic resource on this and does a much better job than I could on the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basic conclusion is that Bandit's when done well are powerful approaches, but also require an organisation to be completely behind the system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considerations from A/B tests (running for a week at minimum, public holidays) need to be applied to Bandit methods too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drawbacks of bandit methods, mainly need for instant feedback, should disqualify these methods when instant feedback is not possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandit methods are great way to run continuous a/b tests without the need to involve a Data Scientist. Designers can upload new pages and can see if the pages are working better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandit methods are less complex to scale than an A/B/n test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally it doesn't really matter. Bandit methods are a natural evolution for an org that has realised the value of A/B tests and is constantly running tests. It's unlikely you'd go from no testing to bandit methods, and A/B tests are a very robust way to approach this problem, perfect for a beginner in this space.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="skeptical"></category><category term="ds"></category><category term="advice"></category><category term="ab"></category><category term="bandit"></category></entry><entry><title>CartPole Q Learning</title><link href="/blog/cartpole-q-learning" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-21T13:20:00+11:00</published><updated>2018-10-21T13:20:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Varun Nayyar</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-10-21:/blog/cartpole-q-learning</id><summary type="html">

&lt;p&gt;I've been learning about reinforcement learning and wonder how it can be applied in my work. A common paradigm of machine learning/data science is to develop a model that can predict and feed those predictions into relatively simple code (or into a report for humans) to make decisions. For example, a bank might use a model to predict probability of default, and use that to suggest an interest rate. In many cases, the hard part is estimating risk, once that's been worked out the decision is easy. Or a charity might look into the profile of it's donors and combine with census data to see what can be done.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been learning about reinforcement learning and wonder how it can be applied in my work. A common paradigm of machine learning/data science is to develop a model that can predict and feed those predictions into relatively simple code (or into a report for humans) to make decisions. For example, a bank might use a model to predict probability of default, and use that to suggest an interest rate. In many cases, the hard part is estimating risk, once that's been worked out the decision is easy. Or a charity might look into the profile of it's donors and combine with census data to see what can be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is not always the case. Games are a fantastic example of needing to process information and then making a decision on how to react. Here the prediction problem is one aspect and optimizing for current state only isn't necessarily a good idea, we need to optimize a bit longer term. Lot's of control problems can also take reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q-Learning"&gt;Q-Learning&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Q-Learning"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're going to dive into this problem using Q-Learning. &lt;a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/02/19/a-long-peek-into-reinforcement-learning.html#q-learning-off-policy-td-control"&gt;This Blog&lt;/a&gt; is generally fantastic, but it also has a nice section on Q-Learning that will be a better reference so I can skip the maths. The basic intuition is that given a various state, we try and choose the action that has better long term reward. This is done by recording all playthroughs (in a smart way) and seeing what actions have what results in each state. In the early stages, the algo has no idea what it's doing and will make choices randomly and see what happens. It will learn that certain actions in a state result tend to result in failure (walking into a goomba in mario) and certain actions result in some kind of reward (jumping into a goomba). More explicitly, each state's value is equal to it's reward and a discounted amount of expected reward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i.e. for a determinstic game with finite state, for action $a$ in state $s$ that moves it to state $s'$ and gives reward $r$
\begin{align}
Q(s,a) = r + \gamma * max_{a} Q(s',a)
\end{align}
where $\gamma$ is the discount factor (higher discount means more short term gain, lower discount means more focus on long term gain). The above is called the Bellman update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Q learning, not only is the immediate reward is looked at, it also looks at the best possible reward from new state. This is kind of a recursive definition, so in reality when we play the game, states have a way of filtering back. An easy way to explain this would be a game called FrozenLake, where you're on a 1d grid where going left leads to your death and going right leads to you surviving and obtaining a reward of 1. Let's make the topology look like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death Safe Safe You Safe Safe Reward&lt;br&gt;
DSSYSSR&lt;br&gt;
0123456&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at the beginning, you're in state 3 and action left and action right are both of unknown reward. Let's say you go all the way to the right and get the reward. No in position 5, you know going right leads to a reward of 1. However restarting the game, position 3 still doesn't know which way to go since 4 and 2 still have no info about Q. Let's say you went right again and this time, entering state 5, you realise that the Q(5,right) = 1 while going left is still 0. Hence we know that Q(4, right) = $\gamma$. Now playing again, Q(3, left/right) = 0, but if you go right again, you realise that Q(4, right) = $\gamma$ which is better than left, so Q(3, right) = $\gamma^2$. Now the game would only go right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, heading left towards your death results in no reward and thus, no information filters back. Setting the reward to -1 would have the same effect as driving the agent away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most games are not deterministic and have elements of chance. Furthermore, instead of death, there might be a reward of 2 to the left we've never checked on. As a result, we add two things. Firstly, we don't always choose the best action, we add an element of randommness using epsilon greedy (&lt;a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/01/23/the-multi-armed-bandit-problem-and-its-solutions.html"&gt;see more of the above blog&lt;/a&gt;) to choose a random action and we also update the Q(s,a) score a little more conservatively each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{align}
Q_{n+1}(s,a) = Q_n(s,a) * (1-\alpha) + \alpha [r + \gamma * max_{a} Q_n(s',a)]
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $\alpha$ close to 1, new information changes the values we have more, and for small $\alpha$, it has less impact. Those among you might realise this can be rewritten as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{align}
Q_{n+1}(s,a) &amp;amp;= \alpha \sum_n (1-\alpha)^n B_n \\
B_n &amp;amp;= [r + \gamma * max_{a} Q_n(s',a)]
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And noting that $\alpha \sum_{n=0} (1-\alpha)^n = 1$, the above can be treated as a weighted expectation. Smaller values of alpha bring the value closer to an unweighted expectation. Hence we can think of choosing the best action in the new state as choosing the best expected action in the new state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Implementing-Q-Learning"&gt;Implementing Q-Learning&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Implementing-Q-Learning"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q-Learning has two common implementations, tabular which works well for games with finite state and Neural Q Learning which uses a neural net to convert state into rewards for various actions. Neural Q learning has been extended to DQN which uses a variety of tricks to improve it's performance (it's quite brittle as is). In neural q learning, the $\alpha $ updating isn't necessary since the neural net will look at all Q(s,a) combinations as part of it's training set. The neural net is being used as a function approximator and could be replaced by any function that can be used as an approximator (trees, k-NN etc), but in general neural nets tend to have very efficient code (GPUs) that allow an extra order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start implementing, I'm going to define an interface, so I can reuse my agent code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

        &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        It&amp;#39;s only necessary to know the number of actions and dim of state&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        In a finite state approach, you can pass that through too&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        if you have more efficient code planned&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;

    
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__getitem__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        item is (state, action) and it returns the Q value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        key is (state, action) and value is the Bellman update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;raise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ne"&gt;NotImplementedError&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        Returns max Q(s, a) for a fixed state, s&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        Returns a that maximises Q(s, a) for a fixed state, s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, let's introduce the game and agent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cartpole"&gt;Cartpole&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Cartpole"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the demonstration of Q-Learning, we're going to use &lt;a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/"&gt;OpenAI's Cartpole&lt;/a&gt;. The Agent here is actually quite straightforward, the magic is happening in the Q function approximator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartpole state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test window is just a progress update. The epsilon greedy algorithm just has a linear drop over training (this may not optimal, different functions or even a different approach to exploration may be better). The run section is just training with optimal action chosen and some pretty pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's define Qtable. Note the bins have been specified from sampling the env and plotting. I've also used knowledge that cart position and velocity is generally less important than pole tip and velocity. This has resulted in 4 &lt;em&gt; 4 &lt;/em&gt; 29 * 8 bins which is 3.7k states.&lt;/p&gt;

                 &lt;/video&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is heavily dependent on my discretization and the gamma and alpha values. Also depending on the epsilon change, you can get much better behaviour with a lot of tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Neural-Q-Learning"&gt;Neural Q Learning&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Neural-Q-Learning"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, we use a neural net to try and predict action from state. The basic topology is we feed in the state and the neural net will predict the Q for the various actions (4 input layers and 2 output layers in this case). To do the training we feed in state, action and bellman value. The neural net will simply mask the action used to calculate the loss function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More precisely, we predict the Q for the (s,a) pair and Q for all a for (s', a). We then fit Q on (s,a) with the bellman update ($\gamma * max_a Q(s',a)$) . This means each step has our neural net running a fit, which makes this quite slow compared to tabular version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chosen topology has 2 hidden layers of 20 nodes each, relu activations, and we combine to the 2 action states with a linear layer. This neural net is quite brittle and the hyper parameters have been copied from an existing implementation. Intuitively, we're updating the neural net each observation and this means that our gradient climbs seem to be changing constantly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, Keras expects everything in form of (n_obs, obs_dim), so a state of dim 4 should be passed in as (1,4) matrix. I've created some convenient interface code, since in neural q, we only fit a single observation and predict a single state at a time. Extensions with DQN will require some extra changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neural Q learning is quite brittle and unstable (these things are addressed in an upgrade called DQN) compared to tabular Q in this case. We can see the neural Q get quite good, then get worse, not to mention how much slower it is. The problem with tabular q is memory size which can grow out of control in more complex problems, especially ones with limited linearity and of course, when we need to interpret from pixels/video as opposed to a much nicer number based interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While chatting with Joe, a bloke I had met at a machine learning meet, the conversation invariably turned to how we hated interviewing and how interview candidates always throw out buzzwords and jump headfirst into problems. We then asked each other our favourite interview questions and jumped in headfirst without thinking.
In order to defend my behaviour, I argued that the question Joe had posed was far more subtle than what Joe had suggested and this is the result.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While chatting with Joe, a bloke I had met at a machine learning meet, the conversation invariably turned to how we hated interviewing and how interview candidates always throw out buzzwords and jump headfirst into problems. We then asked each other our favourite interview questions and jumped in headfirst without thinking.
In order to defend my behaviour, I argued that the question Joe had posed was far more subtle than what Joe had suggested and this is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="The-Game"&gt;The Game&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Game"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game was this: You can bet as much money as you want on the outcome of a coin toss. If it's heads, you win 3x what you bet (plus whatever you bet) while if it's tails, you lose whatever you've bet. A more concrete example, you bet 100 on the toss, if it's heads you win 300 so your total amount is now 400, while if it's tails, you're left with 0. This is obviously a positive game, betting $x$ has an expected return of $x$. (A normal toss game has an expected return of 0 in comparison)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note I define return as winnings. So starting with 100 and leaving with 1000 is a return of 900. I define value as sum of winnings + initial investment. So starting with 100 and leaving with 1000 is a value of 1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subtlety of this game is introduced in the fact that you only get a finite number of turns with this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="The-Subtlety"&gt;The Subtlety&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Subtlety"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this game had only 1 turn, you'd bet as much money as possible on the game. After all, who'd give you a 50% chance at a 300% return, or an expected return of 100% (albeit slightly risky). If this game had infinite number of turns, I would play with the minimum bet each time as my expected return is the minimum bet and the chance of going to 0 is very very rare. Note, this is also why when playing in a casino, you reduce the number of bets you make because each bet has a negative expected return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a finite number of turns, the game changes. If I had 2 turns, betting all my money each time still seems sound since 25% of the time I'd end up 16x or 1500% return with a 25% probability - still appetizing. But nothing 75% of the time. For a game with 10 turns, I'd make a 1 million x return, but this is a 1 in 1024 chance of happening, everything else is 0. Note that my expected return is $(2^n-1)x$ using this strategy, but my median return is $-x$. As $n \rightarrow \infty$ my expected return also grows, but my chance of winning keeps decreasing. Now I don't play the lottery, and if a billionaire decides to match every dollar in the lottery with 3 of his own, I still wouldn't play the game (though I would pool money and buy as many lottery tickets as possible). So obviously, this strategy of betting everything on each toss is not something I'd want to do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Constant-Betting-Strategy"&gt;Constant Betting Strategy&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Constant-Betting-Strategy"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time I posed this question to another, the first response I got was what was I optimizing for? It's clear that optimizing for expected value results in a bet everything each toss, but this is not a good strategy as the number of tosses increase as the chance of any payout diminishes. The next response was to bet half my stash each time so I'd never be out of the game, so I thought I'd look at various statistics for a constant $\lambda$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let $\lambda \in [0,1]$ be the percentage of our current stash $x$ to bet on the toss. Value $V$ after one toss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{align}
V|Heads =&amp;amp; (1-\lambda) x + 4 \lambda x\\
 =&amp;amp; (1 +3 \lambda)x \\
V|Tails =&amp;amp; (1-\lambda) x 
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence $E(V) = (1+\lambda)x$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at 2 tosses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{align}
V|HH =&amp;amp; (1 -\lambda)(V|H) + 4\lambda (V|H) \\
 =&amp;amp; (1 +3 \lambda)(V|H) \\
 =&amp;amp; (1 +3 \lambda)^2x \\
V|HT =&amp;amp; (1 +3 \lambda)(V|T)\\
=&amp;amp; (1 +3 \lambda)(1-\lambda) x
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{align}
V|TT =&amp;amp; (1 -\lambda)(V|T) \\
 =&amp;amp; (1 - \lambda)^2x \\
V|TH =&amp;amp; (1 +3 \lambda)(V|T)\\
=&amp;amp; (1 +3 \lambda)(1-\lambda) x
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should give us some intuition on the distribution. For a particular fixed strategy, i.e. constant $\lambda$, we now have a distribution given number of heads, $h$ and number of tails $t$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\begin{align}
V|H=h, T=t &amp;amp;= (1+3\lambda)^h (1-\lambda)^t x
\end{align}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $\lambda =1 $  we can see that even one tail results in value = 0, while $\lambda=0$ results in a value of x. This is clearly a binomial expansion, and this makes this quite easy to analyse, in that the more heads has strictly more profit for a fixed $h+t$.
Let's have a look at mean, median and 25%, 75% results in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

25%, lambda=0.17: mean%=3.55 25%=1.36 50%=2.48 75%=4.54
50%, lambda=0.33: mean%=9.99 25%=1.05 50%=3.16 75%=9.48
75%, lambda=0.49: mean%=24.95 25%=0.50 50%=2.48 75%=12.20
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Notes"&gt;Notes&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Notes"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A percentile level is not directly comparable in this setting and the percentile graph is best looked at as your range of return for a given $\lambda$. Optimizing for 75% results in your 25% case getting worse, while optimizing for your 25% case reduces your possible returns. The higher the percentile you'd like to optimize for, the higher lambda and vice versa and can be seen as a measure of risk taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Varied-$\lambda$"&gt;Varied $\lambda$&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Varied-$\lambda$"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we can see that a fixed percentage playing mechanism barely taps into the possible value of the game at various percentile levels. Playing 33% of our value each time has a median value of 3.16 which feels surprisingly little given the high payout of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As brought up in the beginning, when I don't have many games left, I'd like to bet more aggressively, since my chances of missing out playing the game is much less and the chance of getting the 4x or 16x multiplier is high enough to be worth the risk. However, if I've already got a large amount earned, I might be less aggressive towards the end as I've already gained a lot of money. However, I'm not sure what the best way to code a strategy like this. Maybe a gratuitous amount of computing power can help work out the answer? See &lt;a href="/blog/reinforcement-tosser"&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, this meant that I ended up reading a lot of resumes and started to develop my own model of what was important, from education to portfolios and things in between. I assume you're going to have an exhaustive interview process anyway, so resume screening really should be about finding people with potential, rather than scouring for potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have biases, I've done this work in many fields now so I think my bias is relatively even, though my background (math/engineering degree, started down PhD path, but walked away) is still fairly biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Education/Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have strong belief that a degree with quantitative backing is vital. Degrees like Maths, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science and Econometrics are generally degrees that form the foundations for a good data scientist. Most degrees don't just teach foundations, but also mould the way a person thinks. My Maths degree makes me more analytical, rigorous and skeptical, while my engineering degree was focused on getting results no matter what hacks were needed. And it's important to have a wide range of skills and make-up in your team as you'll encounter various problems that require different kinds of thinking and approaches. Having a team with no educational diversity results in very narrow thinking and is something you should seek to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer Science Majors - these are probably the more dominant group in Data Science today. Primarily because there is a large amount of programming skill required to be able to DS and a comp sci major already has that down pat. They also have strong-ish maths skills, as computer science deals with a lot of discrete maths so they have a strong foundation to build on. Very good employees to have at any stage of your company. They have a lot of value at the beginning of DS in a company as they have enough software experience to get you off the ground and as your process improves, the amount of code required increases exponentially. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stats/Maths/Physics (Science) Majors - less dominant, but equally important, they form the other side of the coin, in that they're much stronger in the foundations of maths, but tend to have less programming skill. They're usually very well versed in different approaches and bring a degree of rigour and skepticism that's required to build great models. Again useful at all stages, as they bring simple approaches to bear in the beginning, but also tap into more advanced techniques as required and usually tend to stay on top of what's happening in the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineering majors - Engineers are a halfway optimisation between comp sci and science in this field, though many of them don't have a full background to be useful straight away. However, they generally make fantastic project managers, as they tend to be results driven and very aware of pitfalls in planning and also fantastic at turning problems into data science questions. In many ways, this unlocks a lot of value from your team and are ideal people to have if you feel like your DS team gets stuck and flounders a lot. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economics majors - (I haven't had a lot of exposure) What these majors tend to provide is a lot of lateral thinking, strong attempts to understand the domain that they're trying to improve, and an understanding of how to present DS ideas to non-technical people well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, these are more tendencies than specifics, there'll be comp sci majors with better mathematical foundations than most maths/stats majors and maths/stats majors with better programming skill than most comp sci majors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love cross majors, comp sci/stats tend to give the best of both worlds in terms of foundations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Skepticism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comp Sci - are almost always obsessed with Neural Nets of all kinds. They also tend to lack a strong statistical base and many regressions and Bayesian approaches mean nothing to them. They come with strong biases and might need to unlearn a lot of them and this can be an issue. They rarely bring any skepticism to the table and are almost always overly confident about the performance of a model of theirs. There is also diminishing returns in comp sci skill in DS, the open source community puts together efficient implementations, so past a certain point, programming skill is less necessary than software architecture skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maths/Stats - many can barely program and require a lot of training to be useful in this field. If you're unlucky, they'll even consider programming beneath them. And they're severely constrained by their need for rigour and are very dour about their results, which means good models they build might go unnoticed. Require very careful management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineers - tend to be middle of the road in both mathy and comp sci skills and don't really push your team forward in many ways. Over reliance on short term results can mean sacrificing longer term goals which they don't see as well. May also not get any respect from the comp sci/math majors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economics majors - they also come with awful mathematics and programming skills, and are unlikely to have the insight as they were probably stars in their own fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Education (PhDs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm mixed. PhD &amp;gt; undergrad, but PhD = Undergrad + 3 years experience. I think PhDs tend to be overrated, but are a safer bet than untested undergrad. I think experience + degree/PhD is the best combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhDs mean that the person who did them is very self-directed, self motivated and has the ability to learn by themselves, all of which are great features to have in an employee. Assuming a quantitative PhD, they likely have very strong skills in this area that are likely to be of instant use to you. Additionally, given that PhDs are usually from the top undergrads, you have a guarantee that they're generally more intelligent. PhDs tend to be people you need if you're on the cutting edge and are very good for raising the ceiling of your teams ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Skepticism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem is that a PhD doesn't really tell me that much about a person's ability to be an employee. Research and corporate environments are very different and success in one doesn't always translate. The PhD tends to be a very specific and sharp area, &lt;a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/"&gt;see this comic&lt;/a&gt; and while they've got more general skill, they're not necessarily much better than an undergrad, especially if you expect to have a bunch of different problems to solve. Additionally, the PhDs tend to be very top heavy the ones that are intelligent and have the ability to transfer skills, are likely ones to stick around in academia too. Basically a PhD applying is likely more intelligent than an undergrad, but you also know that they probably weren't the best of their cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Portfolio/Github&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to love these things, but I now realise that it's quite a biased way to hire. The presence does make me go from a maybe to a yes, but the lack of one doesn't make me go no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's always fantastic to see a Github profile and portfolio - you instantly get an idea of the candidate's programming ability and a portfolio gives you an insight into how they think and what models they're familiar with. PR to public repos are strongly indicative of an ability to work in a corporate DS environment, and proof they've solved a real world problem with a DS technique is more evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this shows curiosity, which I consider a huge thing in a person. A curious person can be depended on to keep learning, improving and getting better. I argue a curious person with limited skill has more potential than a skilled by uninterested person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Skepticism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github and Portfolio's are very biased towards comp sci type majors, either studying or working in a small firm/startup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated before, there is a diminishing return for programming skill, but there is also a high bar to entry. This means people who have the ability to download, parse and write some code to run a simple model are more likely to have portfolio's than someone with the ability to conceptualise more complicated models, but need help to see that through. Now requirements might differ, but programming is an easier skill to lean than thinking mathematically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite pytorch being written by facebook, tensorflow by google, nearly all the blogs I read on how to use it have been written by people working for a .io or someone at university. As I read somewhere (and have experienced myself), working in a leading tech firm is like working in an alternate reality - they've made developments they've kept secret, but as the open source community has put out their own approaches, the rest of industry has fallen in line of the path of the open source implementations. Which means google and facebook employees have hard skills almost entirely based on non-open tech stacks and while they have ideas on how to solve the problem, they are unfamiliar with the prevailing packages and thus don't really have much to write about. Even startups that came up in the time between tensorflow and pytorch probably wouldn't write blogs about pytorch, again for the same reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only a good thing, so I'm not going to split sections up, but instead point out things I like to see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versatility: If their experience shows a wide variety of problems being solved, that's good, because it shows they're not overly biased to one methodology and they have a wide exposure to methods to solve problems and a very strong sense of good process as approached by many places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft Skills: Hard skills are very rarely transferable. A lot of hard skill in a company is getting used to the way things are done and replicating that skill. Look at things like process changes, picking up things quickly, testing methodology and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity: Hard to generally tell from a resume, but curiosity is a thing that makes for excellent employees. You can tell a lack of it relatively easy if the resume looks cookie cutter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company profile: elite companies in the resume are always strong indicators of success. There are many niche industries out there that are also elite so do make sure to do your research. I also tend to prefer experience in small-mid companies as this usually results in a much better overall skillset, while people in large companies tend to be overspecialised, though this can cut both ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Red Flags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poorly Presented Resume: This job has a huge amount of communication and if the applicant can't put together a resume that looks reasonable and clean, this might be a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matlab: This is a personal peeve of mine, but Matlab on your resume indicates a lack of curiosity in the applicant. I used matlab (it's still one of my top linkedin skills for some reason) and didn't like it, so I sought better alternatives. If you haven't done that, chances are you're not going to have insight into your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, none of the areas can be taken in isolation. A non quant degree but 10 years in google DS mean something, while a PhD in Comp Sci and 5 years building apps builds another story. It also depends on your company, whether you have a large profile and get good applicants, or you need to interview to find diamonds in the rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything else, be aware about your stereotypes and biases in hiring when looking at a resume. We tend to want to hire people like us/fit the company profile and so tech heavy companies hire coders who can do maths, while many consultancies hire problem solvers who can code and do maths, quant firms hire maths guys and try and teach them to code. This sometimes work, but diversity of thought is always important, I &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="skeptical"></category><category term="ds"></category><category term="advice"></category><category term="interview"></category><category term="resume"></category></entry></feed>
